## `Description`

The application is divided into three parts, the admin application, the faculty application, and the student application. The first assignment focused on the admin application. The second, third and fourth assignment focused on the faculty application. This is the first of three assignments that will focus on implementing the student application.

The student application consists of a MEAN stack web application meant for students to enroll and access online courses. This first assignment will implement course access from the students point of view. Students will be able to enroll into a section of a course and then view the modules, lessons and content widgets of the course. Courses that were authored using the faculty applications you’ve been working for the last three assignments.

The student application will be implemented using the MEAN stack. The MEAN stack consists of Angular for dynamic front end rendering, Node as the JavaScript server runtime environment, Express for the middle tier Web services, and Mongo for the database. The application will be split into two projects, one for the front end Angular client application, and a second project for the Node plus Express server side application.
